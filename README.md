# disqus-react

A package for integrating [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) services into React applications.

## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
$ npm install --save disqus-react
```

Using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```bash
$ yarn add disqus-react
```

## Usage

### DiscussionEmbed

This is the component that will load the main Disqus comments section.

```js
import { DiscussionEmbed } from "disqus-react";

<DiscussionEmbed
  shortname="example"
  config={{
    url: this.props.article.url,
    identifier: this.props.article.id,
    title: this.props.article.title,
    language: "zh_TW", //e.g. for Traditional Chinese (Taiwan)
  }}
/>;
```

This component is limited to one instance in the DOM at a time and will handle updates to both the `config` and `shortname` props and reload appropriately with the new discussion thread.

### DiscussionEmbed with SSO

This is an example for setting up the DiscussionEmbed component with SSO. Access to SSO is currently available as an add-on for users with a Business level subscription. This example config is also used on the [Disqus React SSO example](https://disqus-sso-react-demo.glitch.me/), and more information about SSO can be found in [our SSO documentation](https://help.disqus.com/customer/en/articles/1717160-integrating-single-sign-on).

Note: The `config.sso` object is not required for publishers integrating SSO only because `config.sso` is only used when the SSO login is present alongside the Disqus login.

```js
import { DiscussionEmbed } from "disqus-react";

<DiscussionEmbed
  shortname="example"
  config={{
    url: this.props.article.url,
    identifier: this.props.article.id,
    title: this.props.article.title,
    language: "zh_TW",
    remoteAuthS3: "", // Generated by your server (see https://help.disqus.com/customer/en/articles/1717160-integrating-single-sign-on for more details)
    apiKey: "", // Your Disqus API key that can be generated or referenced at https://disqus.com/api/applications/
    sso: {
      name: "SampleNews",
      button: "http://example.com/images/samplenews.gif",
      icon: "http://example.com/favicon.png",
      url: "http://example.com/login/",
      logout: "http://example.com/logout/",
      profile_url: "http://example.com/profileUrlTemplate/{username}",
      width: "800",
      height: "400",
    },
  }}
/>;
```

### CommentCount

This component will display the comment count for the Disqus thread associated with the provided config.

```js
import { CommentCount } from "disqus-react";

<CommentCount
  shortname="example"
  config={{
    url: this.props.article.url,
    identifier: this.props.article.id,
    title: this.props.article.title,
  }}
>
  {/* Placeholder Text */}
  Comments
</CommentCount>;
```

Multiple instances of this component can be included on the same page with different `config` variables (e.g. an article list showing the comment count for each).
However, all threads on the site must be under the same primary site `shortname`. If the component receives a new `shortname`, all instances will be reset with counts for threads matching the updated site.

### CommentEmbed

This component can be used to embed a Disqus comment into your page.

```js
import { CommentEmbed } from "disqus-react";

<CommentEmbed
  commentId={this.props.article.featuredCommentId}
  showMedia={true}
  showParentComment={true}
  width={420}
  height={320}
/>;
```

Multiple instances of this component may be include on the same page with different `commentId` variables and does not require that the embedded comment be under the same primary site `shortname`.

### Recommendations

This component can be used to embed Disqus Recommendations into your page.

```js
import { Recommendations } from "disqus-react";

<Recommendations
  shortname="example"
  config={{
    url: this.props.article.url,
    identifier: this.props.article.id,
    title: this.props.article.title,
  }}
/>;
```

The `config` prop is optional and is used to prevent any discussions on the current page from being included in the recommendations.
This component is limited to one instance in the DOM at a time and will handle updates to the `shortname` prop and reload appropriately with recommended pages for the new forum shortname.

## Skip cleanup

We've added a `skipCleanupOnUnmount` prop to the `CommentCount` component. If you set this to `true`, the component will not be removed from the DOM when the component is unmounted.
This is a workaround for a bug where clean up of the comment count also removes the resources for the `DiscussionEmbed` as well.

## Development

Make sure to run `npm run build` before committing your changes.
